#### Sheets

Using sheets is more or less necessary if you want to view your reset analytics on the website, however if you wish to use google sheets in addition to local storage to store your stats, follow [Talking Mime's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIAo3Lgsk_Q)

## Tracking

#### How It Works

The tracker requires the speedrunigt mod, as it creates records files. These records files provide useful information, including the timeline of the run, information found in the in-game statistics menu, advancements, recipes, and some other things. This tracker stores your stats locally, in the *stats.csv* file. It only stores a run if it has achieved any split, otherwise, it is just added to to the cumulating statistics.

#### Tracked Stats

 - Date and Time: the date and time at which the run ended in UTC
 - Run Type Stats: stats that describe the strategies used in the run
 - Splits: stats that record the time of each split
 - Misc. stats: random stats that aren't used yet but will be used later for research purposes
 - Cumulating stats: stats that record how many resets and how much time since the last run with a split
 - Session Marker: marks the start of the session and the strategy associated with it
