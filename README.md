# **ResetTracker**

## **Setup**

#### Required Mods

 - Atum 1.0.5+
 - SpeedrunIGT 10.7+

#### Settings

After running gui.exe, go to the settings tab. Hover over the settings labels to see a brief description of the setting. If you do not have correctly configured settings, the program will tell you what to do when you try to save them or start tracking.

#### Updating

 - you can update versions by running update.exe
 - you can open the github or update through the gui by clicking on the update menu-button

#### Sheets

Using sheets is NOT necessary, however if you wish to use google sheets in addition to local storage to store your stats, follow [Talking Mime's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIAo3Lgsk_Q)

## **Tracking**

#### Start Tracking

 - to start tracking, click the tracking menu-button to reveal a dropdown
 - it will prompt you to put a session marker; these session markers are used in analysis, so you can associate certain certain strategies with different session markers to distinguish them in analysis and comparison

#### How It Works

The tracker requires the speedrunigt mod, as it creates records files. These records files provide useful information, including the timeline of the run, information found in the in-game statistics menu, advancements, recipes, and some other things. This tracker stores your stats locally, in the *stats.csv* file. It only stores a run if it has achieved any split, otherwise, it is just added to to the cumulating statistics.

#### Tracked Stats

 - Date and Time: the date and time at which the run ended in UTC
 - Run Type Stats: stats that describe the strategies used in the run
 - Splits: stats that record the time of each split
 - Misc. stats: random stats that aren't used yet but will be used later for research purposes
 - Cumulating stats: stats that record how many resets and how much time since the last run with a split
 - Session Marker: marks the start of the session and the strategy associated with it

## **Analysis**

Check out each of the pages on the gui; they all do different things. They all have a button that you press to present the analysis, and a description of the page at the top. All graphs and tables have headers above them. If you hover over those headers, a brief explanation of the graph or table may appear. Choose which session you want to be analyzed by clicking on the black drop-down next to the tabs.
